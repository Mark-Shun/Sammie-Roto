# Sammie-Roto

Sammie-Roto is designed to be a user-friendly tool for AI assisted rotoscoping (masking) of video clips. It serves as a free alternative to commercial solutions such as Adobeâ€™s Roto Brush or DaVinci Resolve Magic Mask. It is generally less accurate than manual rotoscoping, but can usually give a pretty good result with little effort.

### Features
- Includes 3 segmentation models: Sam 2.1 Large, Sam 2.1 Base+, and EfficientTAM_s_512x512.
- Easy to use interface allows seeking through the video and clicking to add points.
- Multi-object support.
- Various mask postprocessing options, including edge-smoothing.
- Multiple export options: Black and White Matte, Alpha channel, and Greenscreen.

### Requirements
- It is recommended to have at least 10GB of disk space on the drive that you install the application to.
- An NVIDIA GPU with at least 6GB VRAM is highly recommended. The application can run on CPU, but will be extremely slow.
