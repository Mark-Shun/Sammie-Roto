Sammie-Roto is designed to be a user-friendly tool for AI assisted masking of video clips. It serves as a free alternative to commercial solutions such as Adobeâ€™s Roto Brush or DaVinci Resolve's Magic Mask. It is generally less accurate than manual rotoscoping, but can usually give a pretty good result with little effort.

You may also be interested in another similar tool that I created, [Cutie-Roto](https://github.com/Zarxrax/Cutie-Roto). While Cutie-Roto and Sammie-Roto both serve a similar purpose, their internal workings are different, so each one might work better in certain situations.
